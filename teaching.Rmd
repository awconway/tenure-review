# Approach to teaching {.first-h1}

>[Teaching philosophy]{}
    I believe the approach I have taken to teaching has been strongly shaped by my experience as a clinician and researcher. In my clinical practice, I deliver patient-centered, evidence-based care. As a teacher, my goal is to deliver learner-centered, evidence-based educational opportunities for students. To achieve this goal, I assess learning needs, capabilities and student preferences in the design and delivery of my teaching strategies.

I recognize the student as a partner in providing relevant knowledge and integrating learning based on respect for the student's preferences, values and needs. In practice, this means that I ensure students' know that I am available and accessible to listen to and answer their questions, as well as provide them with the sense that I am a willing partner in helping them learn. I achieve this through scheduling office hours, providing individual appointments and responding to emails in a timely manner, which is often the most convenient mode of communication for the student profile of my online courses. 

As I do in my clinical practice, for teaching I rely heavily on evidence from the literature about the performance of specific teaching strategies to inform my curriculum development and instructional activities. I have found that, due to the fact that my courses have been delivered online during my employment at the University of Toronto, my focus has been on finding ways to make content interactive and engaging within the constraints of a disconnected learning environment. Bringing examples from my own research and providing opportunities for students to directly engage with a variety of interactive activities, including data analysis, risk of bias assessment has been an effective way to build their experience and skill in the core course learning objectives.

I also recognize that achieving the goal of delivering a truly learner-centered education experience is difficult and requires continual improvement. Approaches I use to improve my teaching include reflecting upon student feedback, comparing strategies with my peers, participating in continuing professional development activities, and experimenting with novel approaches that align with my interest in technology. I look forward to new teaching experiences and further developing my abilities as an educator as I progress in my role as a nursing academic.


# Teaching and mentoring contributions

Prior to my appointment at the University of Toronto I gained experience in teaching at the undergraduate and postgraduate level. I coordinated a large unit in the undergraduate nursing course at Queensland University of Technology (\~ 300 students) in 2014. I was also a tutor for a postgraduate Masters unit at Australian Catholic University in 2013 and 2014 (HLSC640 - Interpreting Health Research - 20 students). During my post-doctoral fellowship, my teaching responsibilities involved supervision of Masters in Nursing (Thesis) students.
I supervised 6 students over 4 semesters during the period from 2015 to 2017.

Since taking up the position of Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto, I have taught two core MN courses - NUR1027 and NUR1127.
Please note that I have one course release each academic year associated with my appointment to the RBC Chair of Cardiovascular Nursing Research role at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre.

## NUR1027 {.break}

This course is the first in a two-part series designed to develop knowledge, skill, and judgment related to research competencies for advanced practice nurses as outlined in the Canadian Nurses' Association document "Advanced Practice Nursing: A Pan-Canadian Framework (2019)". The focus of NUR1027 is on critical examination and reflection on research and evidence-informed practice, with an emphasis on integration of theory and research to guide practice.

NUR1027 is delivered completely online using an asynchronous schedule. I used a variety of innovative techniques to engage students in the teaching material, which were received well by students. Quantitative scores and qualitative responses from the student evaluation reports indicated that these strategies effectively facilitated student learning of complex concepts.

### Interactive exercises using real research data

One innovative strategy I used to facilitate student learning of the concepts related to measurement and statistics in quantitative research was interactive online exercises where students executed basic analyses themselves using data from real clinical research. It has been recommended that education related to statistics in graduate courses should *use real data*, *foster active learning* and *use technology to explore concepts and analyze data*.^[Carver, R., Everson, M., Gabrosek, J., Horton, N., Lock, R., Mocko, M., Rossman, A., Roswell, G.H., Velleman, P., Witmer, J. and Wood, B., 2016. Guidelines for assessment and instruction in statistics education (GAISE) college report 2016.] Also, 'statistics anxiety' is a phenomenon known to negatively impact performance.^[Onwuegbuzie A. (2004). Academic procrastination and statistics anxiety. Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 29(1), 1–19.] In an effort to meet these recommendations as well as to attenuate the perception of 'statistics anxiety', I designed a course webpage that was capable of interspersing 'traditional' learning content, such as text and video, with interactive components that can run statistical analyses *in the cloud*. The interactive components link the webpage where the learning content is presented to a virtual machine running a program that externally computes the analysis using the student's input and then sends the result back where it is presented in the 'output' box in the exercise. A total of 22 interactive exercises were created and interspersed within the learning material covering the topics of 'Measurement in Research (Week 7)', 'Statistical Testing in Research and Critical Appraisal (Week 8)', and 'Descriptive Quantitative Research (Week 9)'. This particular teaching strategy allowed me to showcase aspects of my clinically focused research program, incorporating data from my own studies.

To demonstrate, Figure \@ref(fig:exercise-example) is a screenshot of one of the interactive exercises.^[Can be accessed [here - section 15](https://nur1027.netlify.app/07measure)] This particular exercise was designed to improve students' confidence and ability in interpreting visual representations of quantitative data and to better discern bivariate associations. 

```{r exercise-example, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Interactive exercise example', out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('https://res.cloudinary.com/awconway/image/upload/v1623087595/exercise-example_g8fgug.png')
```

Based on evaluation data, I believe this teaching strategy was a mostly effective way to reinforce learning of concepts in statistics that are notoriously difficult to understand, such as p-values.^[Greenland, S., Senn, S. J., Rothman, K. J., Carlin, J. B., Poole, C., Goodman, S. N., & Altman, D. G. (2016). Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations. European journal of epidemiology, 31(4), 337-350.] There were several student comments indicting that they appreciated the variety of learning resources. For example: 

:::{.quote}
You understand and meet the needs of adult learners with different learning styles. This was demonstrated by the beautifully designed learning modules, videos, discussion questions, and podcasts. I enjoyed the variety of learning tools. It helped to keep me engaged. Returning to school for my nursing masters I was worried about boring, endless readings, but this was not the case. You made learning fun! Thank you for this! 
:::

One important piece of feedback I received from students in the Fall of 2019 about the course was that it was frustrating when encountering technical issues related to the interactive exercises. As the exercises are run on a remote server instance that is free, there can be circumstances where loading times are longer than usual, and connection problems unfortunately cannot be avoided. Due to the fact that the 'backend' of the website uses free computing resources on a public server, I had limited options for resolving this issue without moving to a completely different solution, which would likely have required funding to cover server costs to provide a more reliable service. As a compromise, for the Fall 2020 offering of the course, I enabled a ‘solutions’ toggle, which allowed the students to see the output had the correct answer been entered without having to run the exercise on the server. Based on student feedback, this effectively resolved the issue of frustration associated with the inability to see the answers to exercises if there were connection problems.


### 'Greenscreen' videos

It is a requirement for a course delivered asynchronously that instructional content is recorded and either delivered in an audio or video format. Evidence suggests that student engagement in learning material presented in the video format drops dramatically after even a seemingly small amount of time. Analysis of 6.9m video sessions in edX showed median engagement time for videos less than 6 minutes long was close to 100%, by *dropped to 50%* by the 9 minute mark.^[Brame, Cynthia J. “Effective Educational Videos: Principles and Guidelines for Maximizing Student Learning from Video Content.” CBE life sciences education vol. 15,4 (2016): es6. doi:10.1187/cbe.16-03-0125] Given this evidence, the other 'innovative' teaching strategy I incorporated into NUR1027 was an alternative to the traditional long-form 'lecture'. As can be seen in the [course webpage](https://nur1027.netlify.app), the learning material in most weeks was structured with a series of brief videos ranging from 2-6 minutes, with interspersed learning activities and readings. The videos were purposefully designed to introduce and explain concepts related to the learning objectives. I paid particular attention to the 'production value' of these videos, in an effort to enhance student engagement and satisfaction in a course that is delivered completely online. In this regard, I used 'greenscreen' technology to edit videos in such a way that it appeared I was teaching in a more 'real' environment. Evidence also indicates that eye contact with the lecturer is an important social cue that enhances learning performance.^[Beege, Maik, et al. "Social entities in educational videos: Combining the effects of addressing and professionalism." Computers in Human Behavior 93 (2019): 40-52.] To achieve the effect of 'eye-contact' through video, I used a script and tele-prompting equipment to ensure that my gaze was fixed at the camera during recording. Student feedback indicated the videos achieved the intended effect:

## NUR1127

My goal in teaching NUR1127 was to develop students' ability to identify clinical questions that are important to their practice and better equip them to use evidence to inform decision-making regarding those questions. In other words, I strived to ensure the students, being (future or current) ‘health systems leaders and administrators’, were able to make evidence-informed ‘recommendations’ for practice. My teaching focused around building students' understanding that evidence comes with a gradient of trustworthiness, and that well-developed methods of differentiating the more or less trust- worthy are available (i.e. risk of bias assessments).

Prior to Winter 2020 when I took over NUR1127, the learning material had relied on the Critical Appraisal Skills Program suite of tools. On taking over the course, I restructured the core concepts for the course, including assessments, around the GRADE framework. The GRADE framework stands for ‘Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Developed and Evaluation’. At it’s core, GRADE provides a structured, systematic approach to assess the quality of evidence, and then, based on this quality assessment, provide recommendations for practice that are classified according to a continuum from weak to strong. One  advantage of the GRADE framework is that it moves away from thinking about ‘hierarchies’ of evidence without consideration for quality. Using GRADE allowed me to provide a clear structure for students to move from an assessment of the evidence to a decision so that the vital course objective, being to 'Synthesize research evidence to inform nursing and healthcare leadership practice', was achieved.

I operationalized these concepts into my teaching through webinars demonstrating risk of bias assessments for different types of research designs, and creating opportunity for formative assessments. Unsolicited feedback from a student in the course confirmed to me that, although challenging, the final assignment where students are required to apply the GRADE framework to make a recommendation for practice using evidence from multiple sources was an effective way to: 1) evaluate student's progress towards the course objectives; and 2) solidify student learning of concepts learnt across the full year of content related to research appraisal and utilization in NUR1027 and NUR1127.

:::{.quote}
It took me quite some time to develop the summary of findings table - because A. I needed to have a concrete and comprehensive understanding of the outcome findings and B. I had to go back to 1st semester contents to better understand some of the research concepts, like RR, CI, etc and apply that into interpreting the outcome results, and C. GRADE assessment was another complex process that required careful evaluation - I read all the series of 'GRADE guidelines' articles before I finally got to my GRADE assessment on each outcome - though it was more for my own learning and I wanted to take my time. But, definitely having my SOF table completed with all my outcome results and GRADE assessment, naturally guided me into developing my final recommendation. I found GRADE guidelines 15: going from evidence to recommendation article very helpful. Your lecture video on 'making recommendation for practice' solidified my understanding of some of the concepts/ideas and reassured me that I was on the right track.

## Guest lectures {.break}

I was invited to deliver lectures in a graduate course based on my skills in advanced data analytics and research experience related to critical care. 75% of the students attending my seminar on [Nursing Perspectives in Resuscitation Science Research](#resuseval) rated the quality of the presentation as excellent. Dr Charlene Chu, course instructor for NUR1059, provided a peer evaluation of my teaching performance for the workshops I delivered on data visualization for her course, [NUR1059: Informatics and Technology](#nur1059eval). My contribution to this course included 6 hours of teaching time. The resources and teaching material I developed are available at the [workshop webpage](https://nur1059-dataviz.netlify.app).

**Megan Bittner, Undergraduate Summer Research Placement, Summer 2019**

During the Undergraduate Summer Research Placement, Megan worked on a research project related to transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring for detection of respiratory depression during sedation. I provided Megan with targeted education and guidance around building skills related to using R for data analysis. A link to the goals, activities and resources I prepared for Megan is [here](https://awconway.github.io/USSRP.html). Megan also contributed to a systematic review during her summer research placement, which was subsequently published in the Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing.

**Dan Phan, BScN Work Study Program, Summer 2019**

One aspect of my research involved temperature management. Dan worked assisted with undertaking a systematic review of zero heat flux thermometers. A link to the goals, activities and resources I provided to support Dan during this learning experience is [here](https://awconway.github.io/ZHF-review.html). The systematic review was subsequently published in the Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing.

**Megan Bitner and Dan Phan, BScN Work Study Program, Fall 2019/Winter 2020**

After a successful work term over the summer, I decided to hire both Megan and Dan during the fall. This work study placement involved data collection for a prospective study conducted at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, aiming to validate a scale to measure thirst discomfort before cardiac procedures. The responsibilities for Megan and Dan during this term included liaising with clinical staff to identify potentially eligible participants, explanation of the study to potential participants, and completion of a questionnaire for those who agreed to participate. From November 2019 to March 2020, Megan and Dan screened 203 patients for inclusion in the study. 194 of the 198 eligible participated in the study. The results of this study were subsequently published in the Journal of Radiology Nursing. 

**Kevin Auw-Yang, UTSC Co-op placement, Fall 2019 - Spring 2020**

Kevin was a student enrolled in a BSc degree program at UTSC. Kevin aspired for a career in health, potentially in the field of medicine. I initially hired Kevin through the UTSC Co-op program to assist with a randomized controlled trial of high flow nasal oxygen in the cath lab at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. After a number of weeks of training to undertake tasks related to data collection for this trial, I decided that Kevin would not be able to undertake these activities without constant, direct supervision. As such, I decided to re-assign Kevin's primary duties to undertaking data entry, cleaning and assisting with reporting. 

# Evidence of teaching effectiveness {.break}

## NUR1027 Integrated Approaches to Research Appraisal and Utilization, Part 1

After teaching NUR1027 for the first time in the fall of 2019, I reviewed student evaluations and subsequently made adjustments based on this feedback. The quantitative scores improved noticeably in the evaluation period for the fall of 2020. All of the core institutional and divisional items improved from a median score of 4 to 5 (on a 5-point scale), demonstrating that my teaching effectiveness improved.

### Fall 2019 {.break}

Comments from students on the overall quality of the course are listed below. As this was an online course, most comments related to the choice for delivery of course content (videos/discussion boards). All comments from the course related to my teaching are included. Some comments that addressed generic services (e.g. writing support) or Teaching Assistant performance are not included.

The introduction for certain research concepts were confusing (especially quantitative). After completing learning modules and readings, I did not feel confident that I was able to completely understand the concepts taught for that week. I had to look up concepts in other source online to assist my learning. I think it would be helpful in the future to teach the concepts as if it were being taught to a novice learner, as many students took a statistic/research course several years ago. I think it would also be helpful to provide several examples of application. Discussion posts each week were related to applying concepts to a research study, which was helpful leading up the final assignment. However not all questions were answered and if they were it was uncertain if that student answered it correctly. It would be helpful if Dr. Conway is able to comment on all student's posts to give them good/bad feedback. May also be helpful to post a summary of each week on the discussion board so it is clear how the concepts should be applied and what the correct answers are.

  Overall, I think Aaron is a good instructor. The lectures were clear and easy to understand. What I would have liked to see more of is Aaron demonstrating how to apply the concepts instead of just having the students discuss on the discussion boards. For example, when discussing statistics, I would have liked to see how the instructor would have answered the discussion questions and how he arrived to those answers. 
  Unfortunately, I did not find the sections of the lecture that included coding very useful. I did not find that it helped advance my knowledge of the course concepts. I felt lost in trying to figure out coding that I have never been exposed to in the past.

  Aaron was always quick to respond to my emails. The in–person appointment I had with Aaron increased my understanding of research concepts drastically. I believe, due to the nature of research concepts (p–value, confidence interval, odds ratio), the online learning environment was challenging. Aaron could improve this by hosting more BBCollab to clarify any concepts that students continue to have difficulties understanding despite going through weekly readings and course content. Aaron's video provided a humanistic touch to an online learning environment. Aaron could also provide more examples in his videos related to concepts (especially the challenging concepts) to increase students' understanding of the concepts. The embedded learning activities in between Aaron's videos were very confusing and difficult to understand. Overall, it was a pleasure to have Aaron as my prof!

  The learning activities embedded in the weekly content did not support my learning and I found it to be distracting to try to understand how to use the programs/coding systems to run the examples. I found myself googling a lot of the content. Understandably this is complicated material but I do not feel it was made clear by just the lecture alone.
:::

:::{.quote}
Throughout this course, I found that it was difficult to follow and understand the weekly content in the modules. For example, how the materials were organized was not straight forward and I had to pause many times to take notes from the videos. It would have been more effective for learning if there was an outline for the pertinent materials each week and a break down of the concepts on powerpoint or a physical copy for students to print/download and follow. Further, I did not find the stats stimulations in some weeks helpful in learning about quantitative concepts as I experienced trouble inputing codes etc. Learning about quantitative analyses was the most challenging materials from this course, and unfortunately, I had to use many external sources to understand the quantitative content. Further, on top of the weekly assigned readings, I found that the additional readings embedded in the module added more workload to this course and it was not very effective and engaging for learning. I did enjoy how the TA presented the material on week 11 as the material was detailed and straight forward. Given the exam that comes with this course next semester, I hope that improvements will be made to create a better learning experience.

Thank you Aaron for recording your office hours. I found it helpful to be able to listen to what was discussed when I was not able to join the session at the scheduled time. 
The first and third assignments were unclear as to what was required. A sample of the third assignment was available however, it did not correspond with the rubric. 
The activities in the weekly modules, specifically quantitative research modules, did not work majority of the time. I became frustrated at times because the codes I entered were correct but the result kept reading “error”. When I clicked on “solution” or “answer”, the correct answer was exactly what I entered. 
Overall, the course was good. Aaron was fair and encouraged us to respond to each other’s post and he often joined in the discussions as well. I felt he created a stimulating and impartial learning environment.

The course content was challenging, but extremely good. I though that Aaron and Danielle (the TA) worked well together to answer and elucidate understanding of course content on the forums. Both were very open and responsive to answering questions via video chat, which was much appreciated. I found that the course content was excellently structured, with enough readings (but not too many!) to help me figure out how to learn what I needed to learn. I thought the session by the library, Mikaela Gray, was excellent and a huge benefit in learning how to search databases. 
I appreciated the drop in sessions as well for the assignments. As well, the word limits on forums (while hard to observe at times) were useful in controlling how long people's posts were. 
A few ideas for improvement:
- having drop in sessions throughout the year for students to discuss research concepts (especially during statistics weeks because many students struggled with that?)
- the discussion forums were a great place to learn from other students. However, I think sometimes it felt like you had to have the right answer when you weren't actually very clear on some of the concepts for that week. It might be nice to have a disclaimer that while forums count for marks, it's also a place to share if you are having a good understanding of the concepts or if you need clarification on something. It makes the online community feel more collegial and honest. 
Thank you to the instructor and TA for a wonderful course! I can tell that a lot of work and time went into structuring it and creating it.

  I really enjoyed your approach to teaching. You understand and meet the needs of adult learners with different learning styles. This was demonstrated by the beautifully designed learning modules, videos, discussion questions, and podcasts. I enjoyed the variety of learning tools. It helped to keep me engaged. Returning to school for my nursing masters I was worried about boring, endless readings, but this was not the case. You made learning fun! Thank you for this!

The quality of instruction in this course from Dr. Aaron Conway and Danielle Just (TA) was incredible. As an asynchronous course, I was unsure of how well I would be able to understand the material and communicate any issues to the teaching staff, but both Aaron and Danielle were amazing. The course material provided a good foundation for my understanding of the core concepts, and instructors were available through various means of communication. They were highly responsive and did a great job of taking the time to explain concepts when I was facing difficulties.

  The weekly content varied with the format of the information presented. Some weeks included more video content that made the concepts easier to understand. Some weeks included text words only, which made the content more difficult to grasp.

:::{.quote}
  Everyone has different learning styles, while I appreciate that discussion posts are meant to ensure that students are accountable for weekly readings and to assess learning, they are something I have always found challenging and impersonal. Reflecting on my comprehension and being able to fit it into 250–300 words is especially difficult. I prefer to write short papers or engage in face to face discussion, which I recognize is not reasonable given the asyncronous nature of the HSLA stream. Working full–time on a rotating schedule made it difficult for me to truly engage in the weekly discussions, and I found myself only having enough time to do the minimum expectation (posting once and commenting once) as I didn't have enough time to truly engage in the ongoing discussion. I recognize that this more has to do with my dense work schedule than the actual discussions' content.

## NUR1127 Integrated Approaches to Research Appraisal and Utilization, Part 2 {.break}

After teaching NUR1127 for the first time in the Winter of 2020, I reviewed student evaluations and subsequently made adjustments based on this feedback. The quantitative scores remained consistent in the evaluation period for the Windter of 2021. All of the core institional and divisional items maintained a median score of 4 or 5 (on a 5-point scale), demonstrating that my teaching achieved a high level of satisfaction from students in both terms. It should be noted that the Winter 2020 term was considerably affected by the first wave of COVID-19. In line with recommendations from the Masters Program Coordinator, students were provided with the option to forgoe the last assignment and have their grades from the previous assessments in the course re-distributed. The vast majority of students elected for this offer, reflecting the extraordinary demands on time due to increased clinical responsibilities.

### Winter 2020

Comments from students on the overall quality of the course are listed below. These qualitative responses provide substantive evidence that the various modes of teaching I used throughout this course, including lectures, webinar demonstrations of risk of bias assessments, and moderation of discussion board online participation activities, were effective approaches for supporting student learning. All comments from the course related to my teaching are included. Some comments that addressed generic services (e.g. writing support) or Teaching Assistant performance are not included.

**Comments on the overall quality of the instruction in this course:**

I found Aaron had an amazing ability to share and teach content that is quite complex. There were times I had to re–watch lectures, but that was more due to the pace of the course rather than Aaron's style. He was very helpful when I had questions and I always found him very willing to offer help. He has an extremely detailed rubric system that gave me a clearer understanding of where to start.

:::

I think the content taught was very relevant and current. The course did a great job of teaching us the skills requires to appraise evidence.

Overall I felt that the course was effective. Aaron Conway always asked if the student had any questions and made sure to address all questions before proceeding with material.

:::

:::{.quote}

Material was presented in a clear manner. Helped me to think about material deeper through his thoughtful and knowledgable responses to discussion posts. I felt that some of the testing questions were worded sightly confusing and I could interpret a few of the questions in a couple of ways. I also felt that for the amount of information covered (and studied), the test did not fully represent the material. I would have liked a more comprehensive test/more questions.

:::

:::{.quote}

It was difficult to understand the concepts in depth from the online lectures and I found myself spending a lot of my own time googling or watching youtube videos to understand the concepts. It may have been helpful to go into more depth within the lectures of the concepts as I think for many of us these were new concepts all together and it felt like we needed some background in these topics to be able to understand the lectures.

:::

Assignment guidelines and evaluative criteria were clear and easy to understand. Instruction on learning to be done each week was also clear and very organized.

The discussion board posts is a huge tool that I used to try and understand/apply concepts learned for the week. Some concepts remained unclear, even as I seeked clarification from the weekly lecture notes and assigned readings. When I notice that other students are inquiring about the same concepts, I continue to follow up for answers provided by Aaron or Danielle. Thank you Aaron for providing a lot of clarification and responding to our posts to help us learn the content for the week.

### Winter 2021

Again in this course, comments from students generally supported the quantitative scores, indicating a high level of satisfaction and supporting evidence of effective teaching. Constructive feedback regarding the amount of reading associated with GRADE comments were received, and will be considered in future terms.

**Comments on the overall quality of the instruction in this course:**

Dr. Conway was an excellent professor for this course. He always provided extra support when certain concepts were more difficult to grasp. There were many opportunities for further engagement (webinars), and discussion with peers in weekly discussion groups. 

Dr. Conway was also very receptive to concerns the class had around the structure of the course. Specifically he accommodated student's concerns that the weekly discussions were extremely time consuming. In response, Dr. Conway made the discussion posts optional for the class.

:::
:::{.quote}
I found this course quite heavy. Often in the modules a concept would be taught and then we would be responsible for reading an article or chapter to gain further understanding of the concept. Although this was sometimes effective, I found that with some of the heavier concepts and with some of the readings (which were upwards of 20 pages sometimes) this was hard to manage and I would often have 5,6,7 questions for the discussion board or in an email to the instructor/TA to actually understand the concepts. I also found that this course was particularly heavy during the group presentations. During the group presentations, we were responsible for reviewing the presentation (learning/ understanding the new content within the presentation) and contributing to the discussion, while also completing new course lecture content and completing one's own group assignment. With some more "down" time in the later weeks of the course, i think it would have been useful to have this spread out a bit more– I think that would have given me a bit more time to learn and understand some of the concepts, rather than re–learning some of the information during the last assignment.

:::

This was an amazing course! I learned so much and I feel like it will be useful.

I really enjoyed this course. Aaron's focus on pragmatic application and synthesis of course content is a great strategy for teaching the material. It was really great to learn from Aaron. He was available whenever needed and very prompt in replies. I would recommend this course (even though it's mandatory haha) to anyone! it was very high–quality and Aaron is a top–notch instructor.

:::
:::{.quote}
I found a lot of the material very interesting, but the course structure was a bit challenging to follow. It was hard to wrap my head around the material for each week while also working on the presentation in the first few weeks. However, that may just be a consequence of being in graduate school during a pandemic and not being able to put all of my energy into trying to understand GRADE and ROB vs ROBINS–I. Also, coming up on the end of the semester it's hard to see the big picture of why we're learning some of these things, but again, that may be pandemic fatigue setting in. 

The exam was also surprisingly stressful, again possibly a consequence of trying to study during the pandemic while working – a list of key terms would have at least provided a small foundation of what to memorize. Overall, I feel like I have a solid understanding of how to appraise literature but would like more practical examples of how a manager or educator might use these guidelines in practice.

# Evidence of leadership in teaching

I have contributed to the improvement of teaching beyond my direct interactions with students enrolled in the courses I teach by writing chapters for textbooks and a systematic review related to teaching evidence-based healthcare. I co-authored a textbook chapter on quantitative methods with an academic from the University of Newcastle (Associate Professor Jed Duff). This book chapter is highly aligned with the content I teach for NUR1027, covering research design and interpretation considerations for quantitative research methods. The textbook is used for teaching introductory research methods and evidence-based practice Masters level courses, particularly in Australia.

I also co-authored a chapter for a textbook focused on outlining the need for development of new knowledge and skills related to digital technologies, artificial intelligence and data analytics in the nursing profession. I contributed the content related to the 'nurse as analyst'. This content included a demonstration of the the nurse as analyst role using a public data set as a case study. The chapter has been submitted and is in editorial review phase. The textbook is targeted at the graduate level for courses related to nursing informatics.

I co-authored a systematic review of theory-based strategies for teaching evidence-based practice to undergraduate health students. Athough further research is indicated, this review identified that approaches to teaching evidence-based practice that are grounded in theory were found to produce a small but positive effect on student attitudes.
