<p>Prior to my appointment at the University of Toronto I gained experience in teaching at the undergraduate and postgraduate level. I coordinated a large unit in the undergraduate nursing course at Queensland University of Technology (~ 300 students) in 2014. I was also a tutor for a postgraduate Masters unit at Australian Catholic University in 2013 and 2014 (HLSC640 - Interpreting Health Research - 20 students). During my post-doctoral fellowship, my teaching responsibilities involved supervision of Masters in Nursing (Thesis) students.
I supervised 6 students over 4 semesters during the period from 2015 to 2017.</p>
<p>Since taking up the position of Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto, I have taught two core MN courses - NUR1027 and NUR1127.
Please note that I have one course release each academic year associated with my appointment to the RBC Chair of Cardiovascular Nursing Research role at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre.</p>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">11.1</span> NUR1027<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#nur1027"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This course is the first in a two-part series designed to develop knowledge, skill, and judgment related to research competencies for advanced practice nurses as outlined in the Canadian Nurses’ Association document “Advanced Practice Nursing: A Pan-Canadian Framework (2019)”. The focus of NUR1027 is on critical examination and reflection on research and evidence-informed practice, with an emphasis on integration of theory and research to guide practice.</p>
<p>NUR1027 is delivered completely online using an asynchronous schedule. I used a variety of innovative techniques to engage students in the teaching material, which were received well by students. Quantitative scores and qualitative responses from the student evaluation reports indicated that these strategies effectively facilitated student learning of complex concepts.</p>
<div id="interactive-exercises-using-real-research-data" class="section level3" number="11.1.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">11.1.1</span> Interactive exercises using real research data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#interactive-exercises-using-real-research-data"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>One innovative strategy I used to facilitate student learning of the concepts related to measurement and statistics in quantitative research was interactive online exercises where students executed basic analyses themselves using data from real clinical research. It has been recommended that education related to statistics in graduate courses should <em>use real data</em>, <em>foster active learning</em> and <em>use technology to explore concepts and analyze data</em>.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Carver, R., Everson, M., Gabrosek, J., Horton, N., Lock, R., Mocko, M., Rossman, A., Roswell, G.H., Velleman, P., Witmer, J. and Wood, B., 2016. Guidelines for assessment and instruction in statistics education (GAISE) college report 2016.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a> Also, ‘statistics anxiety’ is a phenomenon known to negatively impact performance.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Onwuegbuzie A. (2004). Academic procrastination and statistics anxiety. Assessment &amp;amp; Evaluation in Higher Education, 29(1), 1–19.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>2</sup></a> In an effort to meet these recommendations as well as to attenuate the perception of ‘statistics anxiety’, I designed a course webpage that was capable of interspersing ‘traditional’ learning content, such as text and video, with interactive components that can run statistical analyses <em>in the cloud</em>. The interactive components link the webpage where the learning content is presented to a virtual machine running a program that externally computes the analysis using the student’s input and then sends the result back where it is presented in the ‘output’ box in the exercise. A total of 22 interactive exercises were created and interspersed within the learning material covering the topics of ‘Measurement in Research (Week 7)’, ‘Statistical Testing in Research and Critical Appraisal (Week 8)’, and ‘Descriptive Quantitative Research (Week 9)’. This particular teaching strategy allowed me to showcase aspects of my clinically focused research program, incorporating data from my own studies.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, Figure <a href="teaching-and-mentoring-contributions.html#fig:exercise-example">11.1</a> is a screenshot of one of the interactive exercises.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Can be accessed &lt;a href="https://nur1027.netlify.app/07measure"&gt;here - section 15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> This particular exercise was designed to improve students’ confidence and ability in interpreting visual representations of quantitative data and to better discern bivariate associations.</p>

</div>
<p>Based on evaluation data, I believe this teaching strategy was a mostly effective way to reinforce learning of concepts in statistics that are notoriously difficult to understand, such as p-values.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Greenland, S., Senn, S. J., Rothman, K. J., Carlin, J. B., Poole, C., Goodman, S. N., &amp;amp; Altman, D. G. (2016). Statistical tests, P values, confidence intervals, and power: a guide to misinterpretations. European journal of epidemiology, 31(4), 337-350.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a> There were several student comments indicting that they appreciated the variety of learning resources. For example:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>You understand and meet the needs of adult learners with different learning styles. This was demonstrated by the beautifully designed learning modules, videos, discussion questions, and podcasts. I enjoyed the variety of learning tools. It helped to keep me engaged. Returning to school for my nursing masters I was worried about boring, endless readings, but this was not the case. You made learning fun! Thank you for this!</p>
</div>
<p>One important piece of feedback I received from students in the Fall of 2019 about the course was that it was frustrating when encountering technical issues related to the interactive exercises. As the exercises are run on a remote server instance that is free, there can be circumstances where loading times are longer than usual, and connection problems unfortunately cannot be avoided. Due to the fact that the ‘backend’ of the website uses free computing resources on a public server, I had limited options for resolving this issue without moving to a completely different solution, which would likely have required funding to cover server costs to provide a more reliable service. As a compromise, for the Fall 2020 offering of the course, I enabled a ‘solutions’ toggle, which allowed the students to see the output had the correct answer been entered without having to run the exercise on the server. Based on student feedback, this effectively resolved the issue of frustration associated with the inability to see the answers to exercises if there were connection problems.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">11.1.2</span> ‘Greenscreen’ videos<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#greenscreen-videos"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It is a requirement for a course delivered asynchronously that instructional content is recorded and either delivered in an audio or video format. Evidence suggests that student engagement in learning material presented in the video format drops dramatically after even a seemingly small amount of time. Analysis of 6.9m video sessions in edX showed median engagement time for videos less than 6 minutes long was close to 100%, by <em>dropped to 50%</em> by the 9 minute mark.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Brame, Cynthia J. “Effective Educational Videos: Principles and Guidelines for Maximizing Student Learning from Video Content.” CBE life sciences education vol. 15,4 (2016): es6. &lt;a href="doi:10.1187/cbe.16-03-0125" class="uri"&gt;doi:10.1187/cbe.16-03-0125&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a> Given this evidence, the other ‘innovative’ teaching strategy I incorporated into NUR1027 was an alternative to the traditional long-form ‘lecture’. As can be seen in the <a href="https://nur1027.netlify.app">course webpage</a>, the learning material in most weeks was structured with a series of brief videos ranging from 2-6 minutes, with interspersed learning activities and readings. The videos were purposefully designed to introduce and explain concepts related to the learning objectives. I paid particular attention to the ‘production value’ of these videos, in an effort to enhance student engagement and satisfaction in a course that is delivered completely online. In this regard, I used ‘greenscreen’ technology to edit videos in such a way that it appeared I was teaching in a more ‘real’ environment. Evidence also indicates that eye contact with the lecturer is an important social cue that enhances learning performance.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Beege, Maik, et al. “Social entities in educational videos: Combining the effects of addressing and professionalism.” Computers in Human Behavior 93 (2019): 40-52.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a> To achieve the effect of ‘eye-contact’ through video, I used a script and tele-prompting equipment to ensure that my gaze was fixed at the camera during recording. Student feedback indicated the videos achieved the intended effect:</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>…the instructor appeared like he was actually teaching us</p>

<div id="nur1127" class="section level2" number="11.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">11.2</span> NUR1127<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#nur1127"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>My goal in teaching NUR1127 was to develop students’ ability to identify clinical questions that are important to their practice and better equip them to use evidence to inform decision-making regarding those questions. In other words, I strived to ensure the students, being (future or current) ‘health systems leaders and administrators’, were able to make evidence-informed ‘recommendations’ for practice. My teaching focused around building students’ understanding that evidence comes with a gradient of trustworthiness, and that well-developed methods of differentiating the more or less trust- worthy are available (i.e. risk of bias assessments).</p>
<p>Prior to Winter 2020 when I took over NUR1127, the learning material had relied on the Critical Appraisal Skills Program suite of tools. On taking over the course, I restructured the core concepts for the course, including assessments, around the GRADE framework. The GRADE framework stands for ‘Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Developed and Evaluation’. At it’s core, GRADE provides a structured, systematic approach to assess the quality of evidence, and then, based on this quality assessment, provide recommendations for practice that are classified according to a continuum from weak to strong. One advantage of the GRADE framework is that it moves away from thinking about ‘hierarchies’ of evidence without consideration for quality. Using GRADE allowed me to provide a clear structure for students to move from an assessment of the evidence to a decision so that the vital course objective, being to ‘Synthesize research evidence to inform nursing and healthcare leadership practice’, was achieved.</p>
<p>I operationalized these concepts into my teaching through webinars demonstrating risk of bias assessments for different types of research designs, and creating opportunity for formative assessments. Unsolicited feedback from a student in the course confirmed to me that, although challenging, the final assignment where students are required to apply the GRADE framework to make a recommendation for practice using evidence from multiple sources was an effective way to: 1) evaluate student’s progress towards the course objectives; and 2) solidify student learning of concepts learnt across the full year of content related to research appraisal and utilization in NUR1027 and NUR1127.</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>It took me quite some time to develop the summary of findings table - because A. I needed to have a concrete and comprehensive understanding of the outcome findings and B. I had to go back to 1st semester contents to better understand some of the research concepts, like RR, CI, etc and apply that into interpreting the outcome results, and C. GRADE assessment was another complex process that required careful evaluation - I read all the series of ‘GRADE guidelines’ articles before I finally got to my GRADE assessment on each outcome - though it was more for my own learning and I wanted to take my time. But, definitely having my SOF table completed with all my outcome results and GRADE assessment, naturally guided me into developing my final recommendation. I found GRADE guidelines 15: going from evidence to recommendation article very helpful. Your lecture video on ‘making recommendation for practice’ solidified my understanding of some of the concepts/ideas and reassured me that I was on the right track.</p>

<p><strong>Megan Bittner, Undergraduate Summer Research Placement, Summer 2019</strong></p>
<p>During the Undergraduate Summer Research Placement, Megan worked on a research project related to transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring for detection of respiratory depression during sedation. I provided Megan with targeted education and guidance around building skills related to using R for data analysis. A link to the goals, activities and resources I prepared for Megan is <a href="https://awconway.github.io/USSRP.html">here</a>. Megan also contributed to a systematic review during her summer research placement, which was subsequently published in the Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Phan, BScN Work Study Program, Summer 2019</strong></p>
<p>One aspect of my research involved temperature management. Dan worked assisted with undertaking a systematic review of zero heat flux thermometers. A link to the goals, activities and resources I provided to support Dan during this learning experience is <a href="https://awconway.github.io/ZHF-review.html">here</a>. The systematic review was subsequently published in the Journal of Clinical Monitoring and Computing.</p>
<p><strong>Megan Bitner and Dan Phan, BScN Work Study Program, Fall 2019/Winter 2020</strong></p>
<p>After a successful work term over the summer, I decided to hire both Megan and Dan during the fall. This work study placement involved data collection for a prospective study conducted at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, aiming to validate a scale to measure thirst discomfort before cardiac procedures. The responsibilities for Megan and Dan during this term included liaising with clinical staff to identify potentially eligible participants, explanation of the study to potential participants, and completion of a questionnaire for those who agreed to participate. From November 2019 to March 2020, Megan and Dan screened 203 patients for inclusion in the study. 194 of the 198 eligible participated in the study. The results of this study were subsequently published in the Journal of Radiology Nursing.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Auw-Yang, UTSC Co-op placement, Fall 2019 - Spring 2020</strong></p>
<p>Kevin was a student enrolled in a BSc degree program at UTSC. Kevin aspired for a career in health, potentially in the field of medicine. I initially hired Kevin through the UTSC Co-op program to assist with a randomized controlled trial of high flow nasal oxygen in the cath lab at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. After a number of weeks of training to undertake tasks related to data collection for this trial, I decided that Kevin would not be able to undertake these activities without constant, direct supervision. As such, I decided to re-assign Kevin’s primary duties to undertaking data entry, cleaning and assisting with reporting.</p>
