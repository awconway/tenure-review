<p>After teaching NUR1027 for the first time in the fall of 2019, I reviewed student evaluations and subsequently made adjustments based on this feedback. The quantitative scores improved noticeably in the evaluation period for the fall of 2020. All of the core institutional and divisional items improved from a median score of 4 to 5 (on a 5-point scale), demonstrating that my teaching effectiveness improved.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The instructor was helpful and willing to answer any confusion about course materials.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>I was not a fan of the video style lectures – too fast &amp; skipped a lot of content from the readings</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>The overall quality of instruction in this course was excellent. Aaron incorporates unique video lectures as well as activities that facilitate learning. In addition, he also uses discussion boards to enhance understanding of concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Professor Aaron Conway supported learning of course material through a variety of different learning techniques, such as interactive modules and guest lectures, which helped to clarify course content. Aaron was present throughout the week on the discussion board, responding to posts and encouraging dialogue between peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Dr. Aaron Conway is a great instructor. The lectures and exercises were very helpful to learn the material.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Aaron’s lectures were clear and informative.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>The introduction for certain research concepts were confusing (especially quantitative). After completing learning modules and readings, I did not feel confident that I was able to completely understand the concepts taught for that week. I had to look up concepts in other source online to assist my learning. I think it would be helpful in the future to teach the concepts as if it were being taught to a novice learner, as many students took a statistic/research course several years ago. I think it would also be helpful to provide several examples of application. Discussion posts each week were related to applying concepts to a research study, which was helpful leading up the final assignment. However not all questions were answered and if they were it was uncertain if that student answered it correctly. It would be helpful if Dr. Conway is able to comment on all student’s posts to give them good/bad feedback. May also be helpful to post a summary of each week on the discussion board so it is clear how the concepts should be applied and what the correct answers are.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Overall the quality was good. Would have been helpful if some of the weeks which did not have a discussion board could have aligned with weeks where assignments were due. I found it difficult to provide the same quality of responses on those weeks.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>The quality of the content was great and I really enjoyed the delivery. It was a huge amount of very technical reading which was overwhelming at times however.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>I really appreciated this basic overview of research methods in nursing. This course seemed more applicable than the one I took in my undergraduate education.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Overall, I think Aaron is a good instructor. The lectures were clear and easy to understand. What I would have liked to see more of is Aaron demonstrating how to apply the concepts instead of just having the students discuss on the discussion boards. For example, when discussing statistics, I would have liked to see how the instructor would have answered the discussion questions and how he arrived to those answers.
Unfortunately, I did not find the sections of the lecture that included coding very useful. I did not find that it helped advance my knowledge of the course concepts. I felt lost in trying to figure out coding that I have never been exposed to in the past.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Instruction was excellent. This course may be enhanced by adding another final sample paper that was quantitative; therefore, students can see papers of both quantitative and qualitative methodologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Instruction in this course was good, it is difficult material to work through online but was presented in a way that broke it down well and made it easier to digest.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Aaron was always quick to respond to my emails. The in–person appointment I had with Aaron increased my understanding of research concepts drastically. I believe, due to the nature of research concepts (p–value, confidence interval, odds ratio), the online learning environment was challenging. Aaron could improve this by hosting more BBCollab to clarify any concepts that students continue to have difficulties understanding despite going through weekly readings and course content. Aaron’s video provided a humanistic touch to an online learning environment. Aaron could also provide more examples in his videos related to concepts (especially the challenging concepts) to increase students’ understanding of the concepts. The embedded learning activities in between Aaron’s videos were very confusing and difficult to understand. Overall, it was a pleasure to have Aaron as my prof!</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>More built in multiple choice and hands–on activities. Enjoyed working through the built in exercises in the weekly course material.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>The learning activities embedded in the weekly content did not support my learning and I found it to be distracting to try to understand how to use the programs/coding systems to run the examples. I found myself googling a lot of the content. Understandably this is complicated material but I do not feel it was made clear by just the lecture alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Throughout this course, I found that it was difficult to follow and understand the weekly content in the modules. For example, how the materials were organized was not straight forward and I had to pause many times to take notes from the videos. It would have been more effective for learning if there was an outline for the pertinent materials each week and a break down of the concepts on powerpoint or a physical copy for students to print/download and follow. Further, I did not find the stats stimulations in some weeks helpful in learning about quantitative concepts as I experienced trouble inputing codes etc. Learning about quantitative analyses was the most challenging materials from this course, and unfortunately, I had to use many external sources to understand the quantitative content. Further, on top of the weekly assigned readings, I found that the additional readings embedded in the module added more workload to this course and it was not very effective and engaging for learning. I did enjoy how the TA presented the material on week 11 as the material was detailed and straight forward. Given the exam that comes with this course next semester, I hope that improvements will be made to create a better learning experience.</p>

<p>Thank you Aaron for recording your office hours. I found it helpful to be able to listen to what was discussed when I was not able to join the session at the scheduled time.
The first and third assignments were unclear as to what was required. A sample of the third assignment was available however, it did not correspond with the rubric.
The activities in the weekly modules, specifically quantitative research modules, did not work majority of the time. I became frustrated at times because the codes I entered were correct but the result kept reading “error”. When I clicked on “solution” or “answer”, the correct answer was exactly what I entered.
Overall, the course was good. Aaron was fair and encouraged us to respond to each other’s post and he often joined in the discussions as well. I felt he created a stimulating and impartial learning environment.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The modules of this course were VERY organized and clear. The readings were relevant to the discussion posts, and the assignments were reasonable and appropriate given the content. Both the course instructor and the TA were very responsive to email, and were active participants in the weekly discussions. It was very apparent that the instructor appreciated that his students are novice researchers and did his best to simplify complex subject matter and make it applicable to our current and future careers. I feel very fortunate to have Professor Conway as an instructor in the winter semester as well. It is obvious that this is a subject he is passionate about.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>The course delivery was very good despite it’s asynchronous nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>The quality was great – the use website used to host our weekly content was very engaging and easy to use</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>The course content was challenging, but extremely good. I though that Aaron and Danielle (the TA) worked well together to answer and elucidate understanding of course content on the forums. Both were very open and responsive to answering questions via video chat, which was much appreciated. I found that the course content was excellently structured, with enough readings (but not too many!) to help me figure out how to learn what I needed to learn. I thought the session by the library, Mikaela Gray, was excellent and a huge benefit in learning how to search databases.
I appreciated the drop in sessions as well for the assignments. As well, the word limits on forums (while hard to observe at times) were useful in controlling how long people’s posts were.
A few ideas for improvement:
- having drop in sessions throughout the year for students to discuss research concepts (especially during statistics weeks because many students struggled with that?)
- the discussion forums were a great place to learn from other students. However, I think sometimes it felt like you had to have the right answer when you weren’t actually very clear on some of the concepts for that week. It might be nice to have a disclaimer that while forums count for marks, it’s also a place to share if you are having a good understanding of the concepts or if you need clarification on something. It makes the online community feel more collegial and honest.
Thank you to the instructor and TA for a wonderful course! I can tell that a lot of work and time went into structuring it and creating it.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>I really liked the powerpoint/video format where the instructor appeared like he was actually teaching us.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>This course provided a very practical approach to learning about appraising research. I have increased confidence in appraising research as well as other skills such as literature searching. The course format was effective to teach the course concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>I really enjoyed your approach to teaching. You understand and meet the needs of adult learners with different learning styles. This was demonstrated by the beautifully designed learning modules, videos, discussion questions, and podcasts. I enjoyed the variety of learning tools. It helped to keep me engaged. Returning to school for my nursing masters I was worried about boring, endless readings, but this was not the case. You made learning fun! Thank you for this!</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>The quality of instruction in this course from Dr. Aaron Conway and Danielle Just (TA) was incredible. As an asynchronous course, I was unsure of how well I would be able to understand the material and communicate any issues to the teaching staff, but both Aaron and Danielle were amazing. The course material provided a good foundation for my understanding of the core concepts, and instructors were available through various means of communication. They were highly responsive and did a great job of taking the time to explain concepts when I was facing difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Professor Conway is approachable, helpful and fair.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>The weekly content varied with the format of the information presented. Some weeks included more video content that made the concepts easier to understand. Some weeks included text words only, which made the content more difficult to grasp.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Everyone has different learning styles, while I appreciate that discussion posts are meant to ensure that students are accountable for weekly readings and to assess learning, they are something I have always found challenging and impersonal. Reflecting on my comprehension and being able to fit it into 250–300 words is especially difficult. I prefer to write short papers or engage in face to face discussion, which I recognize is not reasonable given the asyncronous nature of the HSLA stream. Working full–time on a rotating schedule made it difficult for me to truly engage in the weekly discussions, and I found myself only having enough time to do the minimum expectation (posting once and commenting once) as I didn’t have enough time to truly engage in the ongoing discussion. I recognize that this more has to do with my dense work schedule than the actual discussions’ content.</p>

</h2>
<p>After teaching NUR1127 for the first time in the Winter of 2020, I reviewed student evaluations and subsequently made adjustments based on this feedback. The quantitative scores remained consistent in the evaluation period for the Windter of 2021. All of the core institional and divisional items maintained a median score of 4 or 5 (on a 5-point scale), demonstrating that my teaching achieved a high level of satisfaction from students in both terms. It should be noted that the Winter 2020 term was considerably affected by the first wave of COVID-19. In line with recommendations from the Masters Program Coordinator, students were provided with the option to forgoe the last assignment and have their grades from the previous assessments in the course re-distributed. The vast majority of students elected for this offer, reflecting the extraordinary demands on time due to increased clinical responsibilities.</p>

<p>I found Aaron had an amazing ability to share and teach content that is quite complex. There were times I had to re–watch lectures, but that was more due to the pace of the course rather than Aaron’s style.

</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Material was presented in a clear manner. Helped me to think about material deeper through his thoughtful and knowledgable responses to discussion posts. I felt that some of the testing questions were worded sightly confusing and I could interpret a few of the questions in a couple of ways. I also felt that for the amount of information covered (and studied), the test did not fully represent the material. I would have liked a more comprehensive test/more questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>It was difficult to understand the concepts in depth from the online lectures and I found myself spending a lot of my own time googling or watching youtube videos to understand the concepts. It may have been helpful to go into more depth within the lectures of the concepts as I think for many of us these were new concepts all together and it felt like we needed some background in these topics to be able to understand the lectures.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the live webinars where we were able to watch Aaron apply critical appraisal tools. That was very helpful to see the rationale behind how certain options were selected.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>The discussion board posts is a huge tool that I used to try and understand/apply concepts learned for the week. Some concepts remained unclear, even as I seeked clarification from the weekly lecture notes and assigned readings. When I notice that other students are inquiring about the same concepts, I continue to follow up for answers provided by Aaron or Danielle. Thank you Aaron for providing a lot of clarification and responding to our posts to help us learn the content for the week.</p>

<p>Again in this course, comments from students generally supported the quantitative scores, indicating a high level of satisfaction and supporting evidence of effective teaching. Constructive feedback regarding the amount of reading associated with GRADE comments were received, and will be considered in future terms.</p>

<p>Dr. Conway was an excellent professor for this course. He always provided extra support when certain concepts were more difficult to grasp. There were many opportunities for further engagement (webinars), and discussion with peers in weekly discussion groups.</p>
<p>Dr. Conway was also very receptive to concerns the class had around the structure of the course. Specifically he accommodated student’s concerns that the weekly discussions were extremely time consuming. In response, Dr. Conway made the discussion posts optional for the class.</p>

<p>As always, professor conway is an excellent instructor and very accommodating to students needs.</p>

<p>Course eval was adjusted based on student feedback to reduce workload and I really appreciated that.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Aaron really made the time to ensure I understood the course content. I especially appreciated his patience. He is an excellent instructor!</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Dr. Conway’s expectations within the course were reasonable. I really appreciated his willingness to be flexible with his grading scheme. It was especially challenging to balance full–time nursing work during the second wave where my unit was running especially short staffed and the course content was quite heavy to balance</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>I feel that this course has enhanced my knowledge and ability to critically appraise evidence that is relevant to practice. The assignments provide an opportunity to apply the knowledge in a way that will enhance my ability to appraise research in my practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Overall this course was an excellent addition to my learning journey. I found the build of the course content on the topics covered in the first semester was done with care and consideration. The assignments were valuable and allowed me to make sense of and prove my understanding of the course content.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Aaron is extremely approachable, he offers a mix of Webinars and course weekly learning content that cover the material well. He offers quick and thorough replies as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="quote">
<p>Aaron is able to explain the material in a relatively simple way as much as possible!
He is great!</p>

<p>I found this course quite heavy. Often in the modules a concept would be taught and then we would be responsible for reading an article or chapter to gain further understanding of the concept. Although this was sometimes effective, I found that with some of the heavier concepts and with some of the readings (which were upwards of 20 pages sometimes) this was hard to manage and I would often have 5,6,7 questions for the discussion board or in an email to the instructor/TA to actually understand the concepts. I also found that this course was particularly heavy during the group presentations. During the group presentations, we were responsible for reviewing the presentation (learning/ understanding the new content within the presentation) and contributing to the discussion, while also completing new course lecture content and completing one’s own group assignment. With some more “down” time in the later weeks of the course, i think it would have been useful to have this spread out a bit more– I think that would have given me a bit more time to learn and understand some of the concepts, rather than re–learning some of the information during the last assignment.</p>

<p>This was an amazing course! I learned so much and I feel like it will be useful.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>I really enjoyed this course. Aaron’s focus on pragmatic application and synthesis of course content is a great strategy for teaching the material. It was really great to learn from Aaron. He was available whenever needed and very prompt in replies. I would recommend this course (even though it’s mandatory haha) to anyone! it was very high–quality and Aaron is a top–notch instructor.</p>

<p>I found a lot of the material very interesting, but the course structure was a bit challenging to follow. It was hard to wrap my head around the material for each week while also working on the presentation in the first few weeks. However, that may just be a consequence of being in graduate school during a pandemic and not being able to put all of my energy into trying to understand GRADE and ROB vs ROBINS–I. Also, coming up on the end of the semester it’s hard to see the big picture of why we’re learning some of these things, but again, that may be pandemic fatigue setting in.</p>
<p>The exam was also surprisingly stressful, again possibly a consequence of trying to study during the pandemic while working – a list of key terms would have at least provided a small foundation of what to memorize. Overall, I feel like I have a solid understanding of how to appraise literature but would like more practical examples of how a manager or educator might use these guidelines in practice.</p>

<p>Content could be heavy at times, and there wasn’t always an opportunity to develop an understanding without rushing through the content</p>
