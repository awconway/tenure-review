<p>My research aims to improve outcomes for patients undergoing procedures with sedation. This program of research was heavily influenced by my clinical experience working as a nurse in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Prior to joining Bloomberg Nursing and the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in my role as RBC Chair in Cardiovascular Nursing Research in September 2018, I practiced as a Registered Nurse in the cardiac catheterization laboratory (CCL) setting in Australia for more than 10 years. I was actively involved in clinical research throughout this time. Through my clinical and research experience, I have developed an in-depth understanding of challenges associated with operational issues as well as practical insights into feasible and effective approaches to the conduct of nursing research within this setting. This first-hand practical knowledge and experience ensures the research I undertake is pragmatically designed to optimize participant recruitment, data collection and outcome measurement procedures.</p>
<p>Since my arrival in Canada, I have established new collaborations with researchers and clinicians who posses the complementary expertise required to make significant contributions to the evidence base underlying procedural sedation and analgesia. These include clinical collaborators within the discipline of nursing, as well as in the field of radiology and anesthesiology, but also academic collaborators from computer science and engineering departments at the University of Toronto. Notably, collaborating with these researchers from diverse fields has enabled me to pursue several new projects that leverage machine learning to create innovative solutions for the common problems encountered in procedural sedation.</p>
<p>In my research career to date, I have published 52 peer-reviewed, full-length journal articles, two editorials and a book chapter. I am the principal author for a large majority of these research outputs. As of June 8, 2021, I have 533 citations of my work listed in the Scopus database with a <em>h</em>-index of 12. Google scholar metrics include 1016 citations to my work with a <em>h</em>-index of 16. My research has produced high quality evidence to support clinicianâ€™s decision-making regarding approaches for procedural sedation. This includes two randomized controlled trials, as well as multiple systematic reviews with meta-analyses, including a Cochrane review.</p>
<p><strong>Scholarly work undertaken at the University of Toronto</strong></p>
<p>Since I joined the University of Toronto in September 2018, I have published 18 journal articles, one editorial and one book chapter. Notable publications in highly-ranked journals include a randomized controlled trial in the <em>European Journal of Anaesthesiology</em> and a meta-analysis in <em>Thorax</em>. The scholarly work I have undertaken, which is directed at improving outcomes for patients receiving procedural sedation and analgesia, is primarily organized into the categories of respiratory monitoring and management, sedation monitoring and pre-procedure fasting. Following is a summary of my research in these areas, including publications to date, as well as directions for future research.</p>
