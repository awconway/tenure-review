<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
</div>
<p>I am leading a program of research aiming to optimize the use of capnography for monitoring respiratory depression. The program is quite mature. Initial work involved a meta-analysis published in a highly-ranked journal in the field of Anesthesiology, followed by an observational study funded by my NHMRC Early Career Fellowship, which resulted in two publications (during my term at UofT), with a further paper under review. This strong foundation was successfully leveraged to attract funding from Medtronic for a randomized controlled trial. The trial is on track to start in the Fall.</p>
<p>Another aspect of this program of research involves investigating the potential for using machine learning to predict the duration of apneic events as a way to improve capnography alarm performance characteristics, decrease alarm fatigue and improve patient safety. It is planned to build this line of research on integrating predictions from machine learning models into capnography alarm management towards a point where it is possible to evaluate the efficacy of this approach in a randomized controlled trial. Randomized controlled trials testing alarm conditions that have integrated predictions from machine learning models have been conducted previously in similar contexts, such as intra-operative blood pressure management.</p>
<p>Below are summaries of current and completed projects, which I have worked on during my appointment at the University of Toronto.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Aim: To determine if smart alarm guided treatment of respiratory depression using the Integrated Pulmonary Index is an effective way to implement capnography during nurse-administered sedation.</p>
<p>Design: A parallel cluster randomized trial design will be used. Capnography monitoring will be implemented as standard practice for all patients undergoing procedures with nurse-administered sedation in the four departments participating in the study. Nurses working in the departments will be invited to participate in the randomized controlled trial component of the study. If they choose to participate, they will be randomized to use capnography either with or without the Integrated Pulmonary Index (IPI) enabled.</p>
<p>Setting: Participants will be enrolled from four departments across UHN. The departments include the Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratory and Interventional Radiology departments at the Toronto General Hospital, as well as the Interventional Radiology departments at the Toronto Western Hospital and Mt Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>Sample size: 400 participants.</p>
<p>Publication plan: It is anticipated that there would be at least two publications in academic journals. One would be focused on the main comparisons in alarm metrics between departments randomized to having IPI enabled or disabled. The other publication would be focused on the insights gained from the intensive facilitated implementation process.</p>
<p><strong>Current progress</strong></p>
<p>The ethics application is currently under review. Anticipated start date Fall, 2021.</p>

<p>Data collection was undertaken in Australia, during my term as a Research Fellow at QUT, which was funded by a NHMRC Early Career Fellowship. The analyses and writing components were undertaken at UofT.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Deciphering which capnography waveform abnormalities deserve intervention, and therefore alarms to signal the event to clinicians, from those that do not is an essential step towards successfully implementing this technology into practice. It is possible that capnography alarm management may be improved by using machine learning to create a ‘smart alarm’ that can alert clinicians for apneic events that are predicted to be prolonged. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of machine learning models for predicting, at the 15-second time point, if apnea will be prolonged (defined as apnea that persisted for 30 seconds or more). A secondary analysis of an observational study was conducted. Decision curve analysis indicated that using a random forest model would lead to a better outcome (in terms of the balance between false positive and negative predictions) for capnography alarm management compared to an aggressive strategy where alarms are triggered after 15 seconds of apnea. The model would not be superior to the conservative strategy, where alarms are only triggered after 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Future directions</strong></p>
<p>Results from these analyses are promising. Longer term plans for this program of research are to undertake a similar analysis using a larger sample in a different population (outlined below) to confirm that predictions of apnea duration are accurate enough to optimize capnography alarm conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Based on results from my prior work outlined above, it seems that using information about the history of previous respiratory states may be a promising solution in regards to predicting durations of apneic periods. I now plan to build on these preliminary findings by building a predictive model from a larger sample of participants.</p>
<p>A secondary analysis of data collected as part of an international prospective observational trial of opioid-induced respiratory depression on inpatient wards (the PRODIGY study) will be conducted. PRODIGY was a prospective trial conducted at 16 clinical sites in the United States, Europe, and Asia. It was performed between April 2017 and May 2018 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02811302) and was funded by Medtronic.</p>
<p>This secondary analysis aims to develop and validate a model for predicting the duration of apnea in patients receiving opioids on inpatient wards. The prediction goal is the duration of apneic events. It is proposed that these predictions could be useful for clinical practice if operationalized as a ‘smart-alarm’ by triggering an alert if an apneic event is predicted to last for more than 20 seconds. The predictions will be compared against a <em>default</em> alarm setting for capnography monitors, which triggers an alarm at 30 seconds of apnea. A <em>correct</em> prediction for both settings will be when apnea continues for a further 20 seconds or more after the alert is triggered.</p>
<p><strong>Progress</strong></p>
<p>Dr Carla Jungquist, who was a PI on the PRODIGY study, has received a contract from Medtronic permitting our use of data from the study for the proposed secondary analysis. It is planned for the analyses to be completed within one year (estimated completion date completion Summer 2022).</p>
